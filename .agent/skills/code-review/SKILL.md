# Code Review Skill

## Review Checklist
1. **Correctness**: Does the code do what it's supposed to?
2. **Edge cases**: Are error conditions handled?
3. **Style**: Does it follow project conventions?
4. **Performance**: Are there obvious inefficiencies?

## Feedback Guidelines
- Be specific about what needs to change.
- Explain why, not just what.
- Suggest alternatives when possible.
